The initial reception to Just for a Day from the British music press was lukewarm,[22] in contrast to the enthusiasm with which Slowdive's earlier releases had been met.[23] Jon Ridge, reviewing Just for a Day for Lime Lizard magazine, thought that the album was premature, describing it as "more a continuation, or aqueous celebration rather, than an advancement" compared to the band's "rather spiffing" previous EPs.[24] Dan Maier of Select found Slowdive "too direct" in their musical approach, writing that they "just sing slowly, play fuzzy, and end up sounding like the Cocteau Twins with ballast."[20] Melody Maker was especially disparaging, with critic Paul Lester panning Just for a Day as a "major fucking letdown".[25] Conversely, Simon Williams of NME championed the record, calling it "frequently exceptional" and "a fine, fragrant affair".[16]

In a retrospective essay, Trouser Press deemed the material on Just for a Day inconsistent, but concluded that "the songs that are solid are breathtaking, and those that aren't are at least hypnotic and slowly sensuous."[26] Reappraising the album in 2005 for Pitchfork, Nitsuh Abebe said that "if anything in Slowdive's catalogue will seem dated, it's the overgroomed production on these songs", while nonetheless noting a "terrifically oceanic" quality to Just for a Day as a whole.[17] In his review of the record for AllMusic, Abebe cited the songs "Celia's Dream" and "Erik's Song" in particular as being indicative of what he believed was the more fully realized sound of Slowdive's next album, Souvlaki (1993).[13]

Critic Ned Raggett ranked Just for a Day at number 17 on his decade-end list of the best albums of the 1990s for Freaky Trigger.[27] In 2016, Pitchfork listed it as the seventh best shoegaze album of all time.[28]
