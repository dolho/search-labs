Souvlaki was released in the UK to middling reviews from critics.[17] Dave Simpson of Melody Maker wrote: "'Sing' aside, I would rather drown choking in a bath full of porridge than ever listen to it again."[18] John Mulvey of NME reacted with muted praise, calling Souvlaki "another exemplary product from spangly guitar heaven" but ultimately deeming it a "pretty but unfulfilled" album.[13] In 2015, Slowdive and Alan McGee stated that they felt that Souvlaki was released at a time when dream pop and shoegaze had become unfashionable and the music press were more interested in Britpop bands such as Oasis.[3]

In later years, Souvlaki has been met with more widespread acclaim.[19] In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Jack Rabid praised the album as "quiet, moving, and aggressive simultaneously, mixing trance-like beauty with the deepest delayed guitar sounds around, a sound at once relaxing, soothing, and exciting, and most of all harshly beautiful."[8] Nitsuh Abebe of Pitchfork described it as "a bit of an Essential Slowdive in itself", with songs that are simultaneously "pillowy-soft and passionately deep".[9] Paste's Zach Schonfeld called Souvlaki "the definitive shoegaze statement".[20]

In 1999, critic Ned Raggett ranked Souvlaki at number 83 on his list of the best albums of the 1990s for Freaky Trigger.[21] Pitchfork released a documentary about the album in 2015 as part of its Pitchfork Classic series.[3] The following year, the website listed Souvlaki as the second best shoegaze album of all time.[1]
