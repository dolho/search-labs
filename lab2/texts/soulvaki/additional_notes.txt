Souvlaki was released on 1 June 1993 by Creation Records.[5] It peaked at number 51 on the UK Albums Chart dated 12 June 1993, 19 places lower than Slowdive's 1991 debut album Just for a Day, and spent one week on the chart.[6] Eight months later, the album was released in the US by SBK Records, on 8 February 1994.[7] The US release included four bonus tracks: a previously unreleased cover of "Some Velvet Morning" (written by Lee Hazlewood and originally recorded by Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra in 1967), and three tracks from Slowdive's 1993 5 EP.[8]

A two-disc remastered reissue of Souvlaki was released in 2005 by Castle Music, a subsidiary label of Sanctuary Records.[9][10] The second disc featured the "Some Velvet Morning" cover, two tracks from Slowdive's 1993 Outside Your Room EP, all tracks from their 5 EP, and Bandulu and Reload remixes of 5 track "In Mind". Another two-disc remaster was released by Cherry Red Records on 16 August 2010, featuring the same bonus tracks on the second disc.[11]
